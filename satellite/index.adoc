== Overview
Red Hat Satellite 6 is the evolution of Red Hat's life cycle management platform.

It provides the capabilities that administrators have come to expect in a tool focused on managing systems and content for a global enterprise.

Satellite 6 covers the use cases requested by Satellite 5 customers, but also includes functionality that enables larger scale, federation of content,
better control of systems during the provisioning process, and a much more simplified approach to life cycle management.

Satellite 6 also further evolves the inherent approach to certificate-based entitlements and integrated subscription management.

Satellite 6 is based on years of customer feedback and is an evolution of previous versions.
