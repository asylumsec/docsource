== Asciidoc editors
Github Atom is a great editor with support for editing asciidocs.
The powerful package system in Github atom allows you to extend it to suit your needs.
Open Edit>Preferencs

Click on Install and search for asciidoc.

I find *asciidoctor-preview*, *autocomplete-asciidoc*, and *language-asciidoc* to be helpful in doc generation. 

If you are comfortable with emacs, its also a very powerful editor.

== Asciidoc Skeleton
When working with asciidoc, its good to have a skeleton file to start with. It makes getting to writing documents much easier.

This is the skeleton for this sites documentation. You will find it on each document
