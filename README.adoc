== How to contribute


If you are on linux, and have docker setup you can copy and paste the following
----
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatGov/docs-source/master/setupdocker.sh 
chmod +x setupdocker.sh 
./setupdocker.sh
----

If you have a Mac and are interested in helping, an automation script still needs to be written to setup this project.
